  #### ðŸ‘‰ Introduction 
  Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building scalable and high-performance applications. One of the ways to improve the performance of Node.js applications is by using clusters.

  #### ðŸ‘‰ What is Node.js Cluster Programming?
  Node.js cluster programming is a way to take advantage of multi-core systems by creating child processes that share the same server port. This allows Node.js to handle more requests and    improve the performance of your    application.

  #### ðŸ‘‰ Why Use Node.js Clusters?
  Using Node.js clusters can help you improve the performance of your application by taking advantage of multi-core systems. It can also help you handle more requests and reduce the response time of your application.

  ### ðŸ‘‰ How to Use Node.js Clusters
  To use Node.js clusters, you need to create a master process that manages the child processes. The master process listens for incoming connections and distributes them to the child processes. The child processes handle      the requests and send the response back to the master process.

  ### ðŸ‘‰ Examples
  Check out the examples folder for sample code that demonstrates how to use Node.js clusters.

  ### ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion
  Node.js cluster programming is a powerful tool for improving the performance of your applications. By taking advantage of multi-core systems, you can handle more requests and reduce the response time of your application.
